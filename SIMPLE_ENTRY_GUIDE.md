## 🎯 **Two Ways to Enter Transactions**

### **Method 1: Natural Language (Chat) - FASTEST!**

Just type what you did in plain English/Malay/Manglish!

#### **For Expenses (Money Out):**

```
Examples:
• "I spend 20rm in mamak"
• "paid grab 15.50"
• "bought chicken 45 ringgit"
• "bayar rent 800"
• "petrol 50"
• "lunch 12"
```

**What happens:**
1. Type your message in the chat (AI icon)
2. AI auto-detects: amount, merchant, category
3. Transaction saved immediately
4. Done! ✓

#### **For Sales (Money In):**

```
Examples:
• "sold 5 nasi lemak 25rm"
• "jual 10 coffee total 35 ringgit"
• "dapat 100 from customer"
• "sold satay 50"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI extracts quantity, price, total
2. Auto-categorizes (Food, Beverage, etc.)
3. Saves as "Sale In"
4. Done! ✓

### **Method 2: Form Entry (When You Have Receipt)**

Use this when you want more control or have a receipt to scan.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Tap the camera/receipt button** in the app
2. **Take photo of receipt** (must use camera, not gallery)
3. **AI reads everything:**
   - Merchant name
   - Date, invoice number
   - All items and prices
   - Tax, service charge, totals
4. **Review the extracted data** in the form
5. **Confirm and save**

## 💡 **Tips for Best Results**

### **✅ DO:**
- Keep it simple: "spend 20 mamak"
- Include amount: "grab 15.50"
- Use common terms: "nasi lemak", "grab", "petrol"
- Be specific: "sold 5 coffee 20rm" (quantity + total)

### **❌ DON'T:**
- Over-complicate: ~~"I went to mamak and ordered roti canai..."~~
- Skip the amount: ~~"bought food"~~ → "bought food 25"
- Use ambiguous terms: ~~"stuff 10"~~ → "groceries 10"

## 📊 **Auto-Categorization**

AI automatically detects categories:

| Keywords | Category |
|----------|----------|
| mamak, makan, food, restaurant, nasi, roti | **Food** |
| grab, taxi, petrol, fuel, transport | **Transport** |
| rent, sewa, kedai | **Rent** |
| ayam, chicken, sayur, rice, ingredients | **Supplies/Ingredients** |
| electric, air, gas, bill | **Utilities** |
| packaging, plastic, box | **Packaging** |

**You can override:** Just edit the category in the review form!

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **"AI didn't understand me"**
- Be more specific with amount: "grab 15" not "grab"
- Use simple words: "spend" "paid" "sold" "bought"
- Try different phrasing: "I spend 20 in mamak" → "mamak 20"

### **"Wrong category"**
- Edit it in the review form before saving
- Or just save and edit later in transaction list

### **"Wrong amount"**
- AI might misread "15.50" as "1550"
- Always review before confirming!
- Use clear numbers: "15 point 50" or "15.5"

### **"Want to add more details"**
- Use form entry instead of chat
- Or add after saving (edit transaction)

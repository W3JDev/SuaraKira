Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], creator of SuaraKira, and I'm thrilled to share this with you today!

🎙️ THE PROBLEM:
I watched Malaysian hawkers spend hours every night manually recording sales in notebooks. One missed entry = lost profit visibility. Traditional accounting apps are too complex, too slow, and require too much typing.

💡 THE SOLUTION:
SuaraKira lets you speak naturally ("Sold 10 nasi lemak, 50 ringgit") and AI creates perfect transaction records in seconds. No forms. No spreadsheets. Just talk.

✨ WHAT'S NEW IN V2.0:
We just launched 3 major features:
- 💰 Multi-account tracking with transfers
- 🏷️ Smart categories with 40+ icons
- 💵 Budget alerts (never overspend)

🚀 TECH HIGHLIGHTS:
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for AI processing
- Supabase for real-time sync
- React + TypeScript for bulletproof code
- 100% open source (MIT license)

🎁 IT'S FREE:
No subscriptions. No paywalls. Just deploy on Vercel's free tier and you're good to go.

🙏 HOW YOU CAN HELP:
- Try it at suarakira.vercel.app
- Star us on GitHub
- Share feedback (we read everything!)
- Upvote if you find it useful

Ask me anything about voice AI, small business tech, or building in public. I'm here all day!

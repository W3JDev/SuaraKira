# Product Vision: SuaraKira

## The Problem
Malaysian hawkers transact billions daily but rely on paper notebooks or memory. Existing POS systems are too complex, expensive, and require typing—impossible when hands are oily or busy cooking.

## The Solution
SuaraKira is a "Zero-UI" financial assistant. It uses multimodal AI (Voice & Vision) to capture data invisibly.
*   **Input:** "Jual 5 burger special" (Voice)
*   **Output:** Structured ledger, inventory deduction, profit calculation.

## Strategic Value
*   **For Users:** Saves 1-2 hours of bookkeeping daily.
*   **For w3jdev:** Demonstrates capability in "Edge AI" and highly localized LLM fine-tuning contexts.

## Target Audience
*   Roadside Hawkers (Gerai)
*   Night Market Traders (Pasar Malam)
*   Small Cafe Owners (Kopitiam)
